# shutterctl

This is a personal home automation project. I don't foresee it being of much use to anyone but myself, but feel free to look around.

The designated end goal is to have a RaspberryPi control my window shutters,
with the Pi getting its command messages from a remote client (probably an Android app in the final version).
I could achieve this with less effort on the software end of things, but this project is also an excuse to _finally_ learn Rust.

### Bug bounty program

If you spot a major security flaw and tell me about it instead of using it to break into my home, I'll buy you a beer.

Also, if you find that my code sucks, please tell me about potential improvements.
Whenever I end up learning something interesting from you, I'll buy you a beer as well.
